## Exploratory Spatio-temporal Analysis of Twitter Stream
A huge number of tweets are continuously emerging from all over the world on a daily basis. Analyzing these tweets is a strategic action to enable event discovery, hidden patterns extraction and other useful insights from within a specific area. <br>

In this project, we needs to conduct a spatio-temporal analysis of tweets content. The tweets are to be collected from a Twitter stream API, in order to extract real time information about events as they occur. The three components of location, time, and content of tweets will be used for this exploratory analysis.<br>

The user of the system should see a one-page Web App that displays a map of a certain geographic area. Then s/he can do the following: <br>
- Create a bounding box over the area s/he is interested in.
- A diagram to show the distribution of tweets over time is displayed.
- Then the user selects a single timestamp to explore the content of tweets in this area during this time period.  
 1. the top trendy tweets in this area are listed and scored
 2. word cloud
